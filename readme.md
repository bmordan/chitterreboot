#Chitter reboot
##the frontend challenge

Your task is split into various sub features:

 - Skin the application (mainly css and html) so that it finally looks decent ( there is a small competitor of ours, twitter, their ui is quite decent, RECREATE IT!. )
 - Make the whole front end work with javascript and a templating system ( like handlebarsjs ) to enrich the experience. Make sure that we only serve one html from our server that will initiate the application.
 - Create a JSON API on the server and make the front end talk to that api ( you should create a path like so /api/chitter )
